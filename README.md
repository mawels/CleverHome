As a hobby project, I'm creating a very simple set of python scripts to control devices from a RaspBerry Pi using infrared and rf emitters.

Requeriments:

* A linux computer (as I said, I use a Raspberry PI...)
* Infrared receiver and emitter connected to the computer.
* LIRCd (the Linux Infrared Remote Control daemon)
* RF 433 Mhz emitter and receiver modules (in my case connected to GPIO pins)
